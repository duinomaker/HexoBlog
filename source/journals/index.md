There're at least three possible explanations for your clicking on my avatar.

If you want to inspect my avatar, here's <a href="/images/misc/avatar_hd.png">a high resolution one</a>.

If you want to read my profile, go to <a href="/about/" target="_self">the "About" page</a>.

Otherwise you may already be contemplating the connectivity between blog pages and wondering if there are any pages that can't be reached by simply clicking on a link on the page without tinkering with the address bar, and the answer is yes.

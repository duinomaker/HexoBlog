## Preface

These are my personal notes for *Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs*.

To advance my proficiency in written English, I'll be taking notes in English since April 25, 2020. Although previous works are done in Chinese, I feel no need to translate them, since it would be time-consuming and would have little to do with my comprehension of the book.

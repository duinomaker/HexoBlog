## Preface

These are my *Concrete Mathematics* notes and solutions to the exercises. Warmups are relatively easy, their solutions were able to fit in the page margin. I'll provide photos of them.

To advance my proficiency in written English, I'll be taking notes in English since Apr 25, 2020. Although previous works are done in Chinese, I feel no need to translate them, since it would be time-consuming and would have little to do with my comprehension of the book.

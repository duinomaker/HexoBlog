<p>“In trying to devise a proof by mathematical induction, you may fail for two opposite reasons. You may fail because you try to prove too much: Your $P(n)$ is too heavy a burden. Yet you may also fail because you try to prove too little: Your $P(n)$ is too weak a support. In general, you have to balance the statement of your theorem so that the support is just enough for the burden.”</p><footer style="text-align:right;">—George Pólya, <em>Induction and Analogy in Mathematics</em></footer>

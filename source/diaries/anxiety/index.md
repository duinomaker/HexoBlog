`2020-05-28`

Turn the time back a few weeks, I must have been devoting the wholeness of my self in reading elementary CS books. But the insecurity of compulsory subjects (i.e., advanced mathematics, physics, circuit and electronics technology) soon overwhelmed me. The feeling was disturbing, constantly distracting me from CS books.

To be frank, I don't like myself. There is always something that can change my focus. Compulsory subjects today, and what's next? I was pretty a “Da Vinci” kind of person than a diligent one. Feel like turning to learn another skill if I find myself not competitive in one.

Sorry, I shouldn't have concluded these much. I was just affected by emotion, that something deprives me of my focus on things I consider important. As usual, it's just a common anxiety caused by final exams.

Having configured this editor with my favorite font and style, and set up a lock over all the documents, I’ll start to write diaries on this Mac with Ulysses. Notice that previous diaries, four sheets in total I remember, are not included here. These sheets were filled with anxiety about my poor academic performance or self-punishment for my idleness in school. But now I realize that these aren’t what diaries were intended for; diaries should provide a person with a chance to write down his thoughts, not his complaints.

Disappointed at my problem solving techniques today. Our house is equipped with a solar heat system. In the afternoon, I found out that hot water was no longer available, and the thermometer read only 40 centigrade, peculiar in such a sunny day. I referred to FAQs in the specification, my situation is most probably tank leakage in the effect of broken tubes. Due to my adherence to the belief that

- the water pump is for pumping water into the water tank,
- the pump works if and only if the water tank lacks pressure,
- the water tank lacks pressure if the water tank leaks,

and the fact that

- the pump wasn't working constantly,

I deduced that the water tank doesn't leak. But I was then shocked after my mom found the water meter spinning constantly. The persuasive fact is that the water pump is actually for draining water from the tank rather than for pumping water into the tank, my bases was flawed.

Checking the water meter is an evident method but I didn't come up with. My instinct is to think logically, and I was taught a lesson today that always to check the validity of bases when reasoning.

There're at least three possible explanations for your clicking on my avatar.

If you wanted to inspect my avatar, here's <a href="https://server.duinomaker.top/blog/images/misc/avatar_hd.png">a high resolution one</a>.

If you want to read my profile, go to <a href="/about/" target="_self">the "About" page</a>.

Otherwise you may have noticed something in your address bar that is irrelevant. Apparently, my diary is hidden somewhere in this website. You may find the place by inspecting the corresponding GitHub repository.

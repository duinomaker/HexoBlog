There're possibly three reasons to explain your clicking on my avatar:

1. You wanted to inspect my avatar
2. You wanted to access my profile page
3. You are excited about discovering something different

If it was case one, here's <a href="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/duinomaker/HexoBlog@b46c6cb/source/images/misc/avatar_hd.png">a high resolution one</a>.

If it was case two, go to <a href="/about/">the "About" page</a>.

If it was case three, maybe you have captured something strange in your address bar. Evidently, someplace in my blog conceals my diaries, you may discover the place by inspecting my GitHub repositories.

Have fun!

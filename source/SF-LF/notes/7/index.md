## Inductively Defined Propositions

We can establish propositions inductively by writing *inference rules*. By applying these rules we could proceed a proof by breaking the proposition down into sub-cases. Since an inference rule may contain several premises, applying inference rules is like building up a tree structure.

Theorems and constructors of inductively defined propositions are *evidences*. The type of an evidence is the proposition it is a proof of.

When a function or a proposition is defined, its type may read like `‚Ñï` `‚Üí` `‚Ñô`. Here, `‚Ñï` is an *index* or *annotation*, meaning it accepts a natural number as the *parameter*.

## Using Evidence in Proofs

We can use `destruct` on an evidence to ‚Äúinvert‚Äù it to reason about all the different ways it could have been derived.

The `inversion` tactic behaves like `destruct`, and it automatically rejects sub-goals that are contradictory.

The `induction` tactic behaves like `destruct`, and in each case, it provides an inductive hypothesis for each generated object, saying that the property holds true for it.

## Inductive Relations

A proposition parameterized by a single object is said to define a *property* of that object.

A proposition parameterized by more than one parameters is thought of defining a *relation* between the parameters.

## Case Study: Regular Expressions

If we perform an induction over an evidence term that is not general enough, using the `induction` tactic on it would lose information. This is because `induction` doesn‚Äôt have the ability like `inversion` to reject contradictory goals automatically.

We can use the `remember` tactic to make an evidence more general, and do some discriminations manually.

## Case Study: Improving Reflection

We can define a relation between booleans and proposition like‚Ä¶

    Inductive reflect (P : Prop) : ùîπ ‚Üí ‚Ñô :=
    | ReflectT (H : P) : reflect P true
    | ReflectF (H : ¬¨ P) : reflect P false.

‚Ä¶which says the a boolean is *reflected* in a proposition.

When doing case analysis on a boolean, applying this relation to the boolean amounts to stating its corresponding proposition holds or not holds.

## Additional Exercises

An intriguing exercise is `palindrome_converse`, which says `l` `=` `rev` `l` `‚Üí` `pal` `l`. The intuition is to perform induction on `l`. But the `induction` tactic would not suffice, since the remaining part of a palindrome taken the head away is clearly not again a palindrome, and we cannot prove `pal` for it.

We have to define our own induction principle, taking one element from the head and tail from a list simultaneously. The principle can be defined like‚Ä¶

    ‚àÄ X (P : list X ‚Üí ‚Ñô),
        P [] ‚Üí (‚àÄ x, P [x]) ‚Üí
        (‚àÄ x1 x2 l, P l ‚Üí P (x1 :: l ++ [x2])) ‚Üí
        ‚àÄ l, P l.

‚Ä¶which can be proved by showing‚Ä¶

    ‚àÄ l (P : list X ‚Üí ‚Ñô) n,
        n = length l ‚Üí P l.

‚Ä¶and‚Ä¶

    ‚àÄ (P : ‚Ñï ‚Üí ‚Ñô),
        P 0 ‚Üí P 1 ‚Üí
        (‚àÄ n, P n ‚Üí P (S (S n))) ‚Üí
        ‚àÄ n, P n.

This is like putting lists of the same length into the same ‚Äúgroup‚Äù, and treat the groups like natural numbers. To show that a property holds for all lists, we only need to prove that it holds for all lists of any group.

If we denote a ‚Äúgroup‚Äù of lists of length $n$ as $G_n$ and the property as $P$, the latter can be showed by proving that the property hold for all lists of length $0$ or $1$, and that

$$\forall i,(\forall l, l\in G_i\to P(l))\to\forall l, l\in G_{i+2}\to P(l).$$

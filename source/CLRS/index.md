## Preface

Recently I joined a STITP (Science and Technology Innovation Training Program) team. Our team wish to delve into the field of machine learning, in particular, into graph neural networksâ€”a research hotspot in recent years.

In order to lay a solid foundation for further studies, I chose to read related chapters on *Introduction to Algorithms* first. Here are my notes on these chapters.
